# InteractiveChildrenBook
Created with Unity and Arduino. 
Connection with Arduino is required in order to play. 

Arduino requires connection to 8 buttons (interactive buttons to interact with the world's objects) and two Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04) in order to detect the movement of flipping pages.
